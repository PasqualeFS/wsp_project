					<p>I'm a NEARLY 40-year old Jedi Master of Email Design.  I've been a front-end developer for MindComet (R.I.P.), <a href="https://www.fhmedicalgroup.com/" target="_blank">Florida Hospital Medical Group</a> and am currently taking up residence as a front-end email developer for <a href="http://www.travelclick.com/en/homepage" target="_blank">TravelClick</a>.  You haven't experienced the black magic of web design until you've reverted to table layouts and hacks to make these emails work across all clients and browsers.  It's a fun but frustrating challenge at times.</p>
					<p>Creativity runs in my blood.  I'm the son of a music teacher.  My father taught me piano and singing and I was his student during my high school years.  I also played and marched in band on Clarinet (Bass Clarinet during concert season).  In my life, I have been a magician, balloon artist, professional chef, and theme park/convention singer. I also sang operatic tenor for nine seasons with Orlando Opera Company.  After working nine years as a database administrator and a mortgage closer, I decided I was overdue to return back to a creative role and self-learned web design and development through reading and online classes.</p>
					<div class="clear"> <div>
					<p>Little Wooke is the freelance collaboration my friend, Sean, and I have been trying to get off the ground.  We have been doing work for clients and, unfortunately, have not developed our own website yet.  We both work full time and our focus has been prioritized toward our day jobs, freelance jobs and families. This project will be a great start toward piecing together a library for our personal use.</p>

					<p>On a personal note, I currently reside just north of Orlando proper.  I'm the single dad of one 8-year old Padawan Learner and a seasoned Star Wars geek dating back to 1977 when I first saw the saga at the ripe old age of two.  I started at Full Sail in July of 2014 to finally obtain my B.S. Degree in Web Design and Development in an effort to help me advance in this line of work.</p>

			<!-- Blog, Components -->
			
			<!-- Header Component -->
			<article id="headerComponent">
				<h2>Component 1: On-Scroll Animated Header</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/06/06/on-scroll-animated-header/" target="_blank">Codrops</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/headerComparison.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This style of header is fairly common.  I think it works for all audiences. It starts out with a prominent size and then gets out of the way when the user starts to scroll. </p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>A header like this is nice for minimizing elements that are not part of the main focus.  The navigation, logo and some contact information is still readily available and easily accessible for the user. Once the user scrolls down a bit, the header compresses down and it comes as an afterthought to the larger elements clients want site visitors to focus on within the main content space.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>It's clean, it's simple.  Just over 10 lines of HTML code, followed by some extensive CSS and a light amount of Javascript.  By modifying the colors, fonts and logo area, it can easily be branded for many clients.</p>

			<!-- Navigation Menu Component -->

				<h2>Component 2: Responsive, Flat Navigation Menu</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://cssmenumaker.com/menu/simple-responsive-menu" target="_blank">CSS Menu Maker</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/navmenu.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Here's a standalone navigation component that probably works well for creative settings, light, whimsical and the little flare out underline as the user hovers can make it appealing to a more youthful audience.  Great use for those browsing the web for entertainment websites, blogs and agency-type businesses.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>A prominent navigation menu that utilizes hover effects to show the user what they're about to select.  The solid underline and font-color change on the active state lets them know which page they're currently visiting.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I think it's a simple navigation menu.  It's light and easy to code. It does not have a sub-menu option built in so larger, professional websites with a good deal of subpages may want to utilize a different approach to their navigation altogether.</p>

			<!-- Responsive Full-Screen Background Image Component -->
			<article id="fsbgComponent">
				<h2>Component 3: Responsive Full-Screen Background Image</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.webdesign.org/absolutely-responsive-full-screen-background-images.22549.html" target="_blank">Web Library</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/fullscreenbg.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The full-screen background can be used for just about any target audience because the targeting is set by the image used.  Be it professional business, a surf shop, a marketing agency, or a photographer website, it can be used to reach a wide range of audiences.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>It's a way to make a statement. Big, bold and eye catching.  It give the client a massive display on large screens that fully shrinks down for various mobile devices.  This is a great thing for users on any device.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I'm still blown away by most websites where I see full-screen background images and/or videos.  Some of them are quite breathtaking. When paired with eye-catching fonts and copy that draws interest, it beckons the user to explore further.</p>

			<!-- Social Share Component -->
			<article id="shareComponent">
				<h2>Component 4: Social Media Sharing Menu Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/web-development-tutorials/social-media-share-css-jquery/" target="_blank">Six Revisions</a></p>
				<img class="leftImg" src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/socialshare.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component has applications with almost all audiences.  It's easier to say you wouldn't use it on pages within a private member section of a website that require a login.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Free marketing for the client for users that know someone who has a need to see what the client is promoting. With the onset and massive increase of social sharing and over-sharing, it's safe to say that some form of a sharing option needs to be on nearly all websites.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I'm not sure this is the best looking social share component but it has simple code and should be able to be styled differently than the demo.  Like many of the other components I've chosen, it can take on the look/feel of a client's branding with some minor CSS tweaks.  Icons can be swapped for the most current ones.  This can also easily be modified to include more or less sharing options for other channels such as Instagram, Pinterest, TripAdvisor and more.</p>

				<h2>Component 5: Slide-In Image Box Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/slide-in-image-boxes/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/slideimgboxes.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component lends itself well to users seeking articles, tutorials, blog posts, news updates and more. The audience for a component like this can include a wide range of age groups when themed appropriately.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Clients can find creative ways to display a snippet of content to tease the user in to wanting to see more.  It could be applied toward restaurants, hotels and a wide range of online marketing needs.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I truly love this.  I might like to slow the timing of the animation down that causes the images to fly in from the right. Reading some of the comments on the CSS Tricks page, I see that use of a sprite map was made and this will require some additional research from <a class="bold" href="http://alistapart.com/article/sprites" target="_blank">this article over at A List Apart</a> to fully understand.</p>

			<!-- Call to Action Component -->
			<article id="ctaComponent">
				<h2>Component 6: Call to Action Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://cssdeck.com/labs/call-to-action" target="_blank">CSS Deck</a></p>
				<img class="rightImg" src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/cta.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The audience for these animated CTA buttons is likely those searching the web for online deals. Consumers looking to buy, download, book a hotel, etc. The default state of this component seems to lend itself to a younger audience that would enjoy flashy, attention getters.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client that uses this may have a need for something extremely noticeable that draws the user in.  These animation varieties may be utilized nicely in a variety of marketing needs and themed appropriately to match the overall look and feel of a website.  They can also be made to truly stand out like a neon sign.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>For you to fully undestand what I'm about to say, you need to click on the source link above and view these CTAs in action.  Upon first glance I thought these were incredibly cool simply because they are created with only HTML and CSS.  Looking through the code and playing with it in the browser, I find the colors easy enough to modify but I'll have to continue playing around with the animation shapes and direction cycles to truly see how they work.  The more time I spent on the website trying to understand them, the more I felt they were annoying me and that they animations should be slowed or made more subtle depending on the client.  I would plan to use these sparingly and maybe even not quite as flashy.  Too many on a single page of a website would be overkill.</p>

				<h2>Component 7: Responsive Image Gallery Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/creating-responsive-tiled-layout-with-pure-css/" target="_blank">DWUser.com</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/responsivegallery.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Image galleries have a variety of audiences young and old.  Photographers and artists would use these to display their craft for customers to see.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>There are endless possibilities for a component like this and it's nice for both the client and the user that it can be viewed on various devices due to it being responsive.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I know that I don't want my mobile experience with a website to suffer due to smaller screen size and it's great that this particular gallery accomodates all users regardless of device. This component can easily be set up. HTML only requires two nested divs with an image inside the innermost div. The rest is taken care of by CSS.  Adding some light Javascript helps make it accessible for those with touchscreen devices.  This shouldn't take long to modify based on the theming of the website for each client.</p>

			<!-- Rotating About Us Component -->
			<article id="rotatingaboutComponent">
				<h2>Component 8: Rotating About Us/Team Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://madewithenvy.com/about/" target="_blank">Envy Labs</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/rotatingAboutus.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component is for any and all audiences wanting to know more about (insert company name here) and the team behind what they do.  It has a look and feel that will appeal to those who may be science enthusiasts.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Clients gain trust by introducing customers to the talented individuals that make up their team. It lets users know a little about the people this client trusts with the creation and deployment of their product.  Add to that an image of a friendly face and it immediately creates a sense of being introduced to that person.  The nice thing about these rotating boxes is they offer a look into each of these team members more closely via Twitter, Github, Blogs, etc.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>What originally drew me to this component was my respect for Envy Labs.  Many of my educational courses prior to Full Sail were done via CodeSchool.com.  So I thought I'd have a look at the Envy Labs site to find something useful for this project.  I immediately love the look and feel of this "about our team" component.  It feels like the periodic table but uses the team member's first and last initial. When you click the box, it turns to reveal various ways of learning more about that person.  Out of all the components I've chosen, this is the one I fear the most because I'll be viewing the source directly from the browser for the HTML, CSS and Javascript.  It looks great.  I see a few issues with it that may require me to choose a different component when it's time to develop it later in the month.  Perhaps I'll be able to add in the tweaks that make it work better.  I noticed that theres a square at the bottom right that plays a video. Upon clicking it, the video started up in a lightbox-type setting.  I exited the video lightbox before it was over and the video disappeared from my browser window but the audio continued to play through until the video was over. That could have poor results with a client and user if they're served up something that isn't performing as it should.</p>

				<h2>Component 9: Rotating Banner Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://whoiscarrus.com" target="_blank">WhoIsCarrus.com</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/rotatingBanner.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The old standard.  The rotating banner has applications with a wide variety of audiences.  It's big in most cases so it will be noticeable to young and old alike. Medical patients, travelers, bargain hunters and many others will find this display helps point out some major items they should be aware of.  It's a large call to action in a sense.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>I've seen rotating banners used for hospitals, hoteliers, entertainers and more.  This is a great way for a client to display roughly two to three items of importance before the user starts scrolling below the fold.  By placing links or buttons on the banners it calls the user to click the banner and directs them to the page the client wants them to take notice of.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>Scrolling banners are nice and there are a variety of effects for transitions.  They can be made to fade or slide left. Apple made use of a slider some time ago that went in a variety of directions and even sometimes split in the middle. This particular rotating banner is designed by an Orlando agency that I've done some freelance email work for and hope to work with again in the future. Upon entering the site, the banner transitions to new slides on a timer. At the bottom are two circular buttons where the user can manually transition to the next or previous slide without waiting on the timer.  It does seem that once the user clicks one of the navigational buttons on the banner, the timer stops and does not transition to any additional slides.  I'd like to see if I can reinstate transitions after a user has stopped manually clicking.</p>
