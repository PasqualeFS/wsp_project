					<img class="headshot" src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/headshot.png?raw=true" />
					<p>I'm a NEARLY 40-year old Jedi Master of Email Design.  I've been a front-end developer for MindComet (R.I.P.), <a href="https://www.fhmedicalgroup.com/" target="_blank">Florida Hospital Medical Group</a> and am currently taking up residence as a front-end email developer for <a href="http://www.travelclick.com/en/homepage" target="_blank">TravelClick</a>.  You haven't experienced the black magic of web design until you've reverted to table layouts and hacks to make these emails work across all clients and browsers.  It's a fun but frustrating challenge at times.</p>
					<p>Creativity runs in my blood.  I'm the son of a music teacher.  My father taught me piano and singing and I was his student during my high school years.  I also played and marched in band on Clarinet (Bass Clarinet during concert season).  In my life, I have been a magician, balloon artist, professional chef, and theme park/convention singer. I also sang operatic tenor for nine seasons with Orlando Opera Company.  After working nine years as a database administrator and a mortgage closer, I decided I was overdue to return back to a creative role and self-learned web design and development through reading and online classes.</p>
					<div class="clear"> <div>
					<p>Little Wooke is the freelance collaboration my friend, Sean, and I have been trying to get off the ground.  We have been doing work for clients and, unfortunately, have not developed our own website yet.  We both work full time and our focus has been prioritized toward our day jobs, freelance jobs and families. This project will be a great start toward piecing together a library for our personal use.</p>

					<p>On a personal note, I currently reside just north of Orlando proper.  I'm the single dad of one 8-year old Padawan Learner and a seasoned Star Wars geek dating back to 1977 when I first saw the saga at the ripe old age of two.  I started at Full Sail in July of 2014 to finally obtain my B.S. Degree in Web Design and Development in an effort to help me advance in this line of work.</p>

			<!-- Header Component -->
			<article id="headerComponent">
				<h2>Component 1: Header</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops" target="_blank">Codrops</a></p>
				<img src="images/01_codropsHeader.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The Codrops website is targeted toward web developers seeking to increase knowledge in the creation of various web development and design techniques. Average age group for web designers/developers range from age 20 to age 54.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>While other elements of the Codrops website give a user a sense that the client aims to increase revenue, the header alone does not. The navigational items tell the user that this is more of a community outreach toward people seeking to increase their knowledge in making various website components.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>This header for Codrops uses two primary, contrasting colors for the theme. There's  a light blue background with white text that changes to a darker blue upon hovering. This gives the user a clear visual of what they're about to select. The blue offers feelings of stability and integrity while the white gives off feelings of cleanliness and simplicity.  The logo is located at the top left where most readers will look first being that the eyes read from the top left of the page to right and continue down to the bottom right where the page ends. The user sees the logo first and will move right through the navigation options to the social icons and finally to a light blue magnifying glass indicating a search option. The subtle use of blue bullets between each of the navigation elements help in keeping them equally spaced from one another.  There is one font used for the header navigation, Proxima Nova, and it works well combined with the white color keeping the font clean and easy to read.</p>

			<!-- Front Page CTA Component -->
			<article id="teaserComponent">
				<h2>Component 2: Front Page Teasers</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://oak.is/" target="_blank">Oak.is</a></p>
				<img src="images/02_frontpgCTA.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Oak.is is a parent company that develops applications for web design development teams for collaboration purposes. Their tag line says it all: We make smart tools for productive people.  This site and their applications are targeted toward teams of developers. Again, this is a group of professionals with ages that span from 20 to 54.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The focus of the Oak.is website is revenue. Each of the teasers leads to a different website where developers can try out light versions of each application but will need to purchase higher levels in order to have full access to all of the available tools.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>These three teasers are easily noticed. The images and buttons have hover states and both link out to the respective application website. Two font colors are used across the chosen serif fonts. A dark black to create bold headers that stand out and a subtle, soft grey for body copy for preview descriptions of each application.</p>

			<!-- Full-Screen Background Image Component -->
			<article id="fsbgComponent">
				<h2>Component 3: Full-Screen Background Image</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.barrelny.com" target="_blank">Barrel</a></p>
				<img src="images/03_FSBackground.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Barrel is targeted toward organizations seeking better digital marketing strategies. The age group for this is not specific.</h3>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>When you visit BarrelNY.com, you can easily see that there's a strong focus on customer service. While I think revenue is a goal, there are no links on the website for direct online purchasing of services. There's a strong focus on who Barrel is and what services they provide. Additionally, they want clients/users to know all of the cool things inside their office, what social events they participate in and who their team is comprised of.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The pages of this site that have full screen background images really stand out. They feel spacious and it's easy to see the centered header text as the main focus with an afterthought comprised of a smaller text CTA.  </p>

			<!-- Login/Registration Component -->
			<article id="loginComponent">
				<h2>Component 4: Log In/Registration Form</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.sharethis.com/signin" target="_blank">ShareThis</a></p>
				<img src="images/04_LoginForm.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>ShareThis offers solutions to those who want to make the world more connected. Targeted toward corporations or the individual publisher, the age range can be pretty wide but is likely to be for audiences between ages 13 and 50 seeking a better sharing solution online.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>At first it's clear that ShareThis offers a free solution to users through their call to actions offering code for their application for free. This makes the site feel like it has a focus on customer service and community. When digging a little deeper, there's a contact form for those seeking results with digital campaigns. Pricing and services are not clearly outlined but there's a feel that revenue is one of the client goals and will be discussed after a user submits a form showing their interest.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The login/registration form is very clear and easy for those signing in or signing up for the first time. Each form has a different color header that coincides with the color of the button at the bottom. Minimal subheaders and body copy quickly explain who each form is for. They offer a variety of ways to sign in/sign up either through directly filling out the form fields and clicking the button or by using a selection of linked social networks. There's a clickable solution for users who have forgotten their password and this is a necessity for any site with a login/member section. The create account form also has two checkbox requirements making it clear that you must be a publisher and at least over the age of 13 to utilize the services ShareThis offers.</p>

			<!-- About Us Component -->
			<article id="aboutComponent">
				<h2>Component 5: About Us</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.aweber.com/meet-the-team.htm" target="_blank">AWeber</a></p>
				<img src="images/05_AboutUs.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>AWeber is targeted toward individuals and corporations. The targeted age group should be for all ages 18 and up.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>AWeber is a revenue-based business selling email marketing expertise. Users visiting the site can find company information as well as products and services.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The About Us component uses several font colors. The multicolors are used for headers and the grey for the body copy.  The use of a variety of colors makes for nice, bright, noticeable headers to break down the departments at Aweber. The grey font is truly secondary to the headers. The about us component full of smiling faces of each employee really creates a welcome feeling.</p>

			<!-- Call to Action Component -->

				<h2>Component 6: Call to Action Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/" target="_blank">Fitbit</a></p>
				<img src="images/06_CTA.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Fitbit is targeted toward clients looking to closely track their health. Age groups range from 16 and up.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Client goals are focused on revenue, customer service and community outreach. Users on Fitbit find a good deal of information, new fitness products to purchase and a community of peers trying to get in more steps, exercise and monitor calories. </p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>These call to actions each have a specific role. Users are getting so much information about themselves here and it's clearly displayed. I like how the font size is quite large on the most important piece of information in each box. Icons and status monitors let users know how far they've gone and how much is left to go to reach goals like steps, stairs, calories and more. Fitbit makes use of bright colors for their icons and to express excitement in text areas.</p>

				<h2>Component 7: Image Gallery Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.kellywendtphotography.com/austin-food-photographer/nggallery/thumbnails" target="_blank">Kelly Wendt Photography</a></p>
				<img src="images/07_ImgGallery.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Brides & Grooms, Event coordinators, corporations, entertainment companies, virtually anyone has a need at some time for a photographer in and around Austin, TX and possibly worldwide. The site is likely targeted toward those between the ages of 18 and up.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>I would say that the client is focused on revenue through use of her photography talents.  Users to the site will come here wanting information and visuals like biography information/experience and image galleries showcasing the photographer's work.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I like that this image gallery is not flashy or heavy on animation. There are no fonts used. This client went with square thumbnails with a little white padding and a medium grey border. When users hover, the image is surrounded by a thick, lighter grey border so they can see there's an action involved with viewing the image larger. It's lacking in text instructions that instruct the user to click to open an image but we're in a time when most web users are familiar with this type of functionality.  Users also get a pop-up text description or company name and location in a yellow box when they hover. The description font is the browser default font rendered via the title tag and is not styled as it is not customizable.</p>

			<!-- Rotating About Us Component -->
			<article id="rotatingaboutComponent">
				<h2>Component 8: Footer</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http:fhmedicalgroup.com" target="_blank">Florida Hospital</a></p>
				<img src="images/09_Footer.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This company is targeting those needing medical assistance through primary doctors and specialists. It's targeted toward an adult audience likely to be around age 18 and up and able to make medical choices for themselves or their dependants.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The medical industry is revenue based. While this organization is a not-for-profit and does participate in community outreach and informative health events, there do not offer medical services without a cost to the patient. Users of this site will find an enormous amount of information about medical professionals. There are applications available to find doctors based on location, specialty, availability of online scheduling or they can just search for doctors by name. </p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>This component and the majority of this site are branded in two colors. The use of blue hues against white as the two primary site colors create a sense of warmth and peace. Red buttons and call to actions create a sense of importance or urgency for the user. Red, however, is only used in the footer when a user hovers over a text link or icon.</p>

				<h2>Component 9: Rotating Banner Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://whoiscarrus.com" target="_blank">WhoIsCarrus.com</a></p>
				<img src="images/10_Banner.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Who Is Carrus targets individuals and companies in need of a full service agency for marketing, analytics, website design and social media solutions. This business would be targeted toward all ages 18 and up.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Client needs are revenue based as you can see right at the top of the header/navigation there's a call to action for free estimates and that will more than likely be the only free item they offer. While I know that this company does a good deal of charitable community outreach, the website does not adequately share that information for users.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>This rotating banner is being used to showcase the clients they've had, awards they've won and services they provide. It's a really nice touch that the images and products are used as a reference for font color choices on the various slides that cycle through.  The user navigation buttons are branded to match the Who Is Carrus website theme but each slide uses colors and fonts that work in harmony with the branding of each respective client or award that is shown.</p>

				<h2>Component 10: Hoverable Follow/Social Icons</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://travelingchildrenproject.com/" target="_blank">Traveling Children Project</a></p>
				<img src="images/08_FollowIcons.png" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The target audience for this site is partially in the title.  It is targeted toward traveling children needing activity during their travels. It's easy to see that it's really targeted toward the parent of a child that will be traveling at a time in the near future.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>This site is solely focused on creating a sense of community and encouraging users to download tools that they can give their kids to use for chronicling their trips near or far.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>The logo and banner design on this are a very friendly and warm combination of yellow, brown, blue and orange.  The site designer made a cartoon version of her own child, Christian as part of the site's branding. The font used in the logo is fun and exciting. I can imagine kids sitting on a parent's lap looking at this site together. The share icon component area uses the, sans serif font, Lato and it stands tall and bold next to the icons giving clear instruction for what the user can do with this section. The icons stick to branding starting out with the brown that's used on the site and changing to orange when hovering.</p>
