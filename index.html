					<p>I'm a NEARLY 40-year old Jedi Master of Email Design.  I've been a front-end developer for MindComet (R.I.P.), <a href="https://www.fhmedicalgroup.com/" target="_blank">Florida Hospital Medical Group</a> and am currently taking up residence as a front-end email developer for <a href="http://www.travelclick.com/en/homepage" target="_blank">TravelClick</a>.  You haven't experienced the black magic of web design until you've reverted to table layouts and hacks to make these emails work across all clients and browsers.  It's a fun but frustrating challenge at times.</p>
					<p>Creativity runs in my blood.  I'm the son of a music teacher.  My father taught me piano and singing and I was his student during my high school years.  I also played and marched in band on Clarinet (Bass Clarinet during concert season).  In my life, I have been a magician, balloon artist, professional chef, and theme park/convention singer. I also sang operatic tenor for nine seasons with Orlando Opera Company.  After working nine years as a database administrator and a mortgage closer, I decided I was overdue to return back to a creative role and self-learned web design and development through reading and online classes.</p>
					<div class="clear"> <div>
					<p>Little Wooke is the freelance collaboration my friend, Sean, and I have been trying to get off the ground.  We have been doing work for clients and, unfortunately, have not developed our own website yet.  We both work full time and our focus has been prioritized toward our day jobs, freelance jobs and families. This project will be a great start toward piecing together a library for our personal use.</p>

					<p>On a personal note, I currently reside just north of Orlando proper.  I'm the single dad of one 8-year old Padawan Learner and a seasoned Star Wars geek dating back to 1977 when I first saw the saga at the ripe old age of two.  I started at Full Sail in July of 2014 to finally obtain my B.S. Degree in Web Design and Development in an effort to help me advance in this line of work.</p>

			<article id="headerComponent">
				<h2>Component 1: Header</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops" target="_blank">Codrops</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/01_codropsHeader.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The Codrops website is targeted toward web developers seeking to increase knowledge in the creation of various web development and design techniques.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>This header component allows clients to provide users a variety of elements such as brand recognition in the form of a logo or company name, contact information, social network connections and more.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>This particular header for Codrops utilizes two primary colors for the theme, a light blue background with white white text that changes to a darker blue upon hovering. This is nice and gives the user a clear visual of what they're about to select. The blue background offers feelings of stability and integrity while the white gives off feelings of cleanliness and simplicity.  The logo is simple and legible located at the top left where most readers will look first being that the eyes read from the top left of the page to right and continue down to the bottom right where the page ends. The user sees the logo first and will move right through the navigation options to the social icons and finally to a light blue magnifying glass indicating a search option. The subtle use of blue bullets between each of the navigation elements help in keeping them equally distanced from one another.  There is one font used for the header navigation, Proxima Nova, and it works well combined with the white color keeping the font clean and easy to read.</p>

			<!-- Navigation Menu Component -->
			<article id="menuComponent">
				<h2>Component 2: Responsive, Flat Navigation Menu</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://cssmenumaker.com/menu/simple-responsive-menu" target="_blank">CSS Menu Maker</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/navmenu.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Here's a standalone navigation component that probably works well for creative settings, light, whimsical and the little flare out underline as the user hovers can make it appealing to a more youthful audience.  Great use for those browsing the web for entertainment websites, blogs and agency-type businesses.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>A prominent navigation menu that utilizes hover effects to show the user what they're about to select.  The solid underline and font-color change on the active state lets them know which page they're currently visiting. A clear and concise navigation menu can help to increase conversions.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I think it's a simple navigation menu.  It's light and easy to code. It does not have a sub-menu option built in so larger, professional websites with a good deal of subpages may want to utilize a different approach to their navigation altogether.</p>

				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.webdesign.org/absolutely-responsive-full-screen-background-images.22549.html" target="_blank">Web Library</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/fullscreenbg.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The full-screen background can be used for just about any target audience because the targeting is set by the image used.  Be it professional business, a surf shop, a marketing agency, or a photographer website, it can be used to reach a wide range of audiences.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>It's a way to make a statement. Big, bold and eye catching.  It give the client a massive display on large screens that fully shrinks down for various mobile devices.  This is a great thing for users on any device.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I'm still blown away by most websites where I see full-screen background images and/or videos.  Some of them are quite breathtaking. When paired with eye-catching fonts and copy that draws interest, it beckons the user to explore further.</p>

			<!-- Social Share Component -->

				<h2>Component 4: Social Media Sharing Menu Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/tutorials/web-development-tutorials/social-media-share-css-jquery/" target="_blank">Six Revisions</a></p>
				<img class="leftImg" src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/socialshare.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component has applications with almost all audiences.  It's easier to say you wouldn't use it on pages within a private member section of a website that require a login.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Free marketing for the client for users that know someone who has a need to see what the client is promoting. With the onset and massive increase of social sharing and over-sharing, it's safe to say that some form of a sharing option needs to be on nearly all websites.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I'm not sure this is the best looking social share component but it has simple code and should be able to be styled differently than the demo.  Like many of the other components I've chosen, it can take on the look/feel of a client's branding with some minor CSS tweaks.  Icons can be swapped for the most current ones.  This can also easily be modified to include more or less sharing options for other channels such as Instagram, Pinterest, TripAdvisor and more.</p>

				<h2>Component 5: Slide-In Image Box Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/slide-in-image-boxes/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/slideimgboxes.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component lends itself well to users seeking articles, tutorials, blog posts, news updates and more. The audience for a component like this can include a wide range of age groups when themed appropriately.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Clients can find creative ways to display a snippet of content to tease the user in to wanting to see more.  It could be applied toward restaurants, hotels and a wide range of online marketing needs.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I truly love this.  I might like to slow the timing of the animation down that causes the images to fly in from the right. Reading some of the comments on the CSS Tricks page, I see that use of a sprite map was made and this will require some additional research from <a class="bold" href="http://alistapart.com/article/sprites" target="_blank">this article over at A List Apart</a> to fully understand.</p>

			<!-- Call to Action Component -->
			<article id="ctaComponent">
				<h2>Component 6: Call to Action Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://cssdeck.com/labs/call-to-action" target="_blank">CSS Deck</a></p>
				<img class="rightImg" src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/cta.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The audience for these animated CTA buttons is likely those searching the web for online deals. Consumers looking to buy, download, book a hotel, etc. The default state of this component seems to lend itself to a younger audience that would enjoy flashy, attention getters.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>The client that uses this may have a need for something extremely noticeable that draws the user in.  These animation varieties may be utilized nicely in a variety of marketing needs and themed appropriately to match the overall look and feel of a website.  They can also be made to truly stand out like a neon sign. These can assist in increasing user participation and the amount of time spent on a website.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>For you to fully undestand what I'm about to say, you need to click on the source link above and view these CTAs in action.  Upon first glance I thought these were incredibly cool simply because they are created with only HTML and CSS.  Looking through the code and playing with it in the browser, I find the colors easy enough to modify but I'll have to continue playing around with the animation shapes and direction cycles to truly see how they work.  The more time I spent on the website trying to understand them, the more I felt they were annoying me and that they animations should be slowed or made more subtle depending on the client.  I would plan to use these sparingly and maybe even not quite as flashy.  Too many on a single page of a website would be overkill.</p>

				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/responsivegallery.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Image galleries have a variety of audiences young and old.  Photographers and artists would use these to display their craft for customers to see.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>There are endless possibilities for a component like this and it's nice for both the client and the user that it can be viewed on various devices due to it being responsive.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I know that I don't want my mobile experience with a website to suffer due to smaller screen size and it's great that this particular gallery accomodates all users regardless of device. This component can easily be set up. HTML only requires two nested divs with an image inside the innermost div. The rest is taken care of by CSS.  Adding some light Javascript helps make it accessible for those with touchscreen devices.  This shouldn't take long to modify based on the theming of the website for each client.</p>
				<p class="subText">Reference: In my search, I did not find any articles that discuss client need/user need as much as I kept finding resources written by Photographers stating the pros and cons of various Photo Galleries where their clients can have an option to pay and download photos taken by a professional photographer.

			<!-- Rotating About Us Component -->
			<article id="rotatingaboutComponent">
				<h2>Component 8: Rotating About Us/Team Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://madewithenvy.com/about/" target="_blank">Envy Labs</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/rotatingAboutus.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component is for any and all audiences wanting to know more about (insert company name here) and the team behind what they do.  It has a look and feel that will appeal to those who may be science enthusiasts.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>Clients gain trust by introducing customers to the talented individuals that make up their team. It lets users know a little about the people this client trusts with the creation and deployment of their product.  Add to that an image of a friendly face and it immediately creates a sense of being introduced to that person.  The nice thing about these rotating boxes is they offer a look into each of these team members more closely via Twitter, Github, Blogs, etc.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>What originally drew me to this component was my respect for Envy Labs.  Many of my educational courses prior to Full Sail were done via CodeSchool.com.  So I thought I'd have a look at the Envy Labs site to find something useful for this project.  I immediately love the look and feel of this "about our team" component.  It feels like the periodic table but uses the team member's first and last initial. When you click the box, it turns to reveal various ways of learning more about that person.  Out of all the components I've chosen, this is the one I fear the most because I'll be viewing the source directly from the browser for the HTML, CSS and Javascript.  It looks great.  I see a few issues with it that may require me to choose a different component when it's time to develop it later in the month.  Perhaps I'll be able to add in the tweaks that make it work better.  I noticed that theres a square at the bottom right that plays a video. Upon clicking it, the video started up in a lightbox-type setting.  I exited the video lightbox before it was over and the video disappeared from my browser window but the audio continued to play through until the video was over. That could have poor results with a client and user if they're served up something that isn't performing as it should.</p>

			<article id="rotatingBanner">
				<h2>Component 9: Rotating Banner Component</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://whoiscarrus.com" target="_blank">WhoIsCarrus.com</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/rotatingBanner.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The old standard.  The rotating banner has applications with a wide variety of audiences.  It's big in most cases so it will be noticeable to young and old alike. Medical patients, travelers, bargain hunters and many others will find this display helps point out some major items they should be aware of.  It's a large call to action in a sense.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>I've seen rotating banners used for hospitals, hoteliers, entertainers and more.  This is a great way for a client to display roughly two to three items of importance before the user starts scrolling below the fold.  By placing links or buttons on the banners it calls the user to click the banner and directs them to the page the client wants them to take notice of. According to one article, eye tracking and A/B testing found that users don't interact with rotating banners. It goes on to even say that they're found to be annoying. However, this still proves to be an easy method for clients to advertise multiple items on a single page and can be more cost effective with regard to time and money spent on development hours.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>Scrolling banners are nice and there are a variety of effects for transitions.  They can be made to fade or slide left. Apple made use of a slider some time ago that went in a variety of directions and even sometimes split in the middle. This particular rotating banner is designed by an Orlando agency that I've done some freelance email work for and hope to work with again in the future. Upon entering the site, the banner transitions to new slides on a timer. At the bottom are two circular buttons where the user can manually transition to the next or previous slide without waiting on the timer.  It does seem that once the user clicks one of the navigational buttons on the banner, the timer stops and does not transition to any additional slides.  I'd like to see if I can reinstate transitions after a user has stopped manually clicking.</p>

				<h2>Component 10: Hoverable Follow/Social Icons</h2>

				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/hoverFollowicons.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This component can be targeted specifically toward online users young and old seeking to follow a person or company online.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>For the client, this is a great tool to entice the user toward continuing to see what is happening with them.  Whether it's status updates on Facebook, Twitter, reviews on Yelp and Tripadvisor for restaurants and hoteliers, many clients and users will find a user for this component.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>This follow component on Traveling Children Project is themed to match this site for parents and children but the simplicity of it being icons that swap colors upon the user hovering makes it easy to modify depending on the client needs or target audience. While these icons are widely used on nearly every site that I find myself visiting, it's said they distract from the primary call to action and essentially remove a user from your site.  I still feel these icons won't be going away any time soon as we continue to progress into a world where the idea of sharing is considered free advertisement. I tend to wonder if we will ever see this trend go away.  Until then, most clients want this on their websites, email campaigns and even in printed materials.</p>
