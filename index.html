					<p>I'm a NEARLY 40-year old Jedi Master of Email Design.  I've been a front-end developer for MindComet (R.I.P.), <a href="https://www.fhmedicalgroup.com/" target="_blank">Florida Hospital Medical Group</a> and am currently taking up residence as a front-end email developer for <a href="http://www.travelclick.com/en/homepage" target="_blank">TravelClick</a>.  You haven't experienced the black magic of web design until you've reverted to table layouts and hacks to make these emails work across all clients and browsers.  It's a fun but frustrating challenge at times.</p>
					<p>Creativity runs in my blood.  I'm the son of a music teacher.  My father taught me piano and singing and I was his student during my high school years.  I also played and marched in band on Clarinet (Bass Clarinet during concert season).  In my life, I have been a magician, balloon artist, professional chef, and theme park/convention singer. I also sang operatic tenor for nine seasons with Orlando Opera Company.  After working nine years as a database administrator and a mortgage closer, I decided I was overdue to return back to a creative role and self-learned web design and development through reading and online classes.</p>
					<div class="clear"> <div>
					<p>Little Wooke is the freelance collaboration my friend, Sean, and I have been trying to get off the ground.  We have been doing work for clients and, unfortunately, have not developed our own website yet.  We both work full time and our focus has been prioritized toward our day jobs, freelance jobs and families. This project will be a great start toward piecing together a library for our personal use.</p>

					<p>On a personal note, I currently reside just north of Orlando proper.  I'm the single dad of one 8-year old Padawan Learner and a seasoned Star Wars geek dating back to 1977 when I first saw the saga at the ripe old age of two.  I started at Full Sail in July of 2014 to finally obtain my B.S. Degree in Web Design and Development in an effort to help me advance in this line of work.</p>

			<!-- Header Component -->
			<article id="headerComponent">
				<h2>Component 1: On-Scroll Animated Header</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/06/06/on-scroll-animated-header/" target="_blank">Codrops</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/headerComparison.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>This style of header is fairly common.  I think it works for all audiences. It starts out with a prominent size and then gets out of the way when the user starts to scroll. </p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>A header like this is nice for minimizing elements that are not part of the main focus.  The navigation, logo and some contact information is still readily available and easily accessible for the user. Once the user scrolls down a bit, the header compresses down and it comes as an afterthought to the larger elements clients want site visitors to focus on within the main content space.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>It's clean, it's simple.  Just over 10 lines of HTML code, followed by some extensive CSS and a light amount of Javascript.  By modifying the colors, fonts and logo area, it can easily be branded for many clients.</p>

				<h2>Component 2: Responsive, Flat Navigation Menu</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://cssmenumaker.com/menu/simple-responsive-menu" target="_blank">CSS Menu Maker</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/navmenu.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>Here's a standalone navigation component that probably works well for creative settings, light, whimsical and the little flare out underline as the user hovers can make it appealing to a more youthful audience.  Great use for those browsing the web for entertainment websites, blogs and agency-type businesses.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>A prominent navigation menu that utilizes hover effects to show the user what they're about to select.  The solid underline and font-color change on the active state lets them know which page they're currently visiting.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I think it's a simple navigation menu.  It's light and easy to code. It does not have a sub-menu option built in so larger, professional websites with a good deal of subpages may want to utilize a different approach to their navigation altogether.</p>

			<!-- Responsive Full-Screen Background Image Component -->
			<article id="fsbgComponent">
				<h2>Component 3: Responsive Full-Screen Background Image</h2>
				<p class="subText">Source: <a href="http://www.webdesign.org/absolutely-responsive-full-screen-background-images.22549.html" target="_blank">Web Library</a></p>
				<img src="https://github.com/PasqualeFS/wsp_project/blob/gh-pages/images/fullscreenbg.png?raw=true" />
				<h3>Target Audience</h3>
				<p>The full-screen background can be used for just about any target audience because the targeting is set by the image used.  Be it professional business, a surf shop, a marketing agency, or a photographer website, it can be used to reach a wide range of audiences.</p>
				<h3>Client/User Needs</h3>
				<p>It's a way to make a statement. Big, bold and eye catching.  It give the client a massive display on large screens that fully shrinks down for various mobile devices.  This is a great thing for users on any device.</p>
				<h3>Critique</h3>
				<p>I'm still blown away by most websites where I see full-screen background images and/or videos.  Some of them are quite breathtaking. When paired with eye-catching fonts and copy that draws interest, it beckons the user to explore further.</p>
